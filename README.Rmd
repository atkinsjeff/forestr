## forestr

The forestr package calculates forest structure and canopy structure metrics from multiple data forms, including two-dimensional portable canopy LiDAR (PCL) raw data files and from certain processed three-dimensional terrestrial LiDAR scanner (TLS) data forms. 

## Installation

To install version 1.0.1 which is on CRAN
```{r eval = FALSE}
install_packages("forestr")
```

To install the development version
```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("atkinsjeff/forestr")
```

## Usage
To process raw PCL data, which comes in .csv form as two columns:  column one is a string of numbers that represent return distance in meters, and column two is a string of integers that represent return intensity. 

You can run an example data set that is included, a 40 m forest transect from Ordway-Swisher Biological Station in Hawthorn, FL.

The `process_pcl` function writes data to an output folder that is created in the working directory.

```{r eval = FALSE}

require(forestr)

process_pcl(osbs, save_output = FALSE)
```

The output includes:

1) an output.csv file that contains 24 canopy structral complexity (CSC) metrics including rumple, canopy rugosity, and max canopy height. These metrics are defined in [Hardiman et al. 2013](http://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/4/3/537/htm) and in Atkins et al. (In review at Methods in Ecology and Evolution.

2) an output_hit_matrix.csv file that is a file that contains the adjusted VAI by x and z position in the canopy. 

3) a summary_matrix.csv file that gives the mean height, max heights, VAI and variance metrics by each columnar position, or x position along the transect. 


## Plotting

The forestr package also produces hit grids--vegetation area index (VAI) for by 1 squared meter bins on the x and z axis through the canopy.

##Worked Example

Let's do a complete run using data from a red pine plantation in Michigan. These data are saved in the `data` folder as `red_pine.rda` in the master GitHub directory and can be accessed as `red_pine` and processed as such where we will look at all of the optional parameters:

```{r eval = TRUE}
red_pine <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atkinsjeff/forestr/master/data-raw/red_pine_plain1.CSV"
forestr::process_pcl(red_pine, user_height = 1.05, marker.spacing = 10, max.vai = 8, pavd = TRUE, hist = TRUE, output.file = TRUE )
```

Running the following command produces the following output to the console:
